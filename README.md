# holahaus

HolaHaus is a project I helped my girlfriend with. She redesign the entire brand and needed a page to show the animations of her design. 

I developed then a SPA with nice animations on scroll and hover to give life to the clean and nice layout she made. There's also an 'Add to cart' function (no state management)
and a small form validation with RegEx.

As the deadline was coming way too soon, I couldn't develop mobile or tablet sizes, so it's just from 1200px onwards.
